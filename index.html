        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate IT graduate from a small village next to Piła city, located in the northern part of Poland.
            I've got interested in computers in 2020 when I had to choose my high school. I chose IT school, because 
            I thought that this was the best option for me. As a child, I always loved to know how different pieces of
            electronics work. Today, I am proud IT graduate and with knowledge I got from my teachers I can finally 
            do what I wanted to do - repair computers.</p>

            <h3>- Musical road</h3>
            <p>In the year of 2025 it is 11 years since I started the music journey. When I started, I was experimenting with
                a digital piano that was laying around in my house. I grabbed it, turned it on and tried to play one of 
                beginners' song, "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." Since then, I learned by myself how to play the piano, 
                I did some performances in the primary school, I went to private music school for about two years and 
                I went to public music school for about a year, where I learned to play on accordion. The best performance I did
                was at my cousin's wedding party. I played two songs on both instruments there. First song was a hit from 
                a famous 90s band called Bad Boys Blue. The song is called "You're a Woman" and I played it on a digital piano with
                a music band which was performing live on the wedding party. The second song is called "Żono Moja" from small boys band
                from Poland called Masters. Both performances were loved by the crowd. Then I was performing once in a while in technical school
                in a school music band called "Kate's Band" on holiday performances.
